# Radar System Project

## Overview
This project implements a radar system using the ESP32 and Arduino.  
It is designed to detect objects and measure their distance using radar technology.

## Features
- Object detection with real-time distance measurement
- Simple and efficient Arduino code
- ESP32 microcontroller for processing and communication
- Clear visualization of radar data (you can mention how, e.g., serial monitor or display)

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Development Board  
- Radar sensor/module (specify model)  
- Connecting wires  
- Power supply

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE  
- Necessary libraries (list any specific libraries you use)

## How to Use
1. Connect the radar sensor to the ESP32 according to the wiring diagram.  
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `Radar__project.ino` file.  
3. Configure any necessary parameters in the code if needed.  
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.  
5. Open the Serial Monitor to view radar data in real-time.  

## Project Structure
- `Radar__project.ino`: Main Arduino sketch file containing the radar system code  
- Additional files/folders if you have any (explain briefly)
